This folder is an example of what is generated from the site folder in the `extra-example` directory.  After making changes to the `extra-example/site` folder contents, cd into the `extra-example` directory and run `zod site www` and you will create a new output in the `extra-example/www` directory. (This README.md file will be deleted after the first update.)
